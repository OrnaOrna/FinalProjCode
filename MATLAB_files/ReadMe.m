% - Part of a final project in the engineering faculty  
% - Bar-Ilan University, October 2024

% ----------------- Structure -----------------
%   Most files are a part of top-level realization of the RAMBAM masking
% scheme propused in "Redundancy AES Masking Basis for Attack Mitigation" 
%   The files "hamming_weight_dist.m", "write_matrices_to_file.m" and 
% "write_to_file.m" are not part of the realization but are used for
% different purposes
%   The file RAMBAM_module is the top module 

% ----------------- Notes On The Realization -----------------
%   Most linear operations are implemented by multiplying by transformation
% matrix of the linear operator
